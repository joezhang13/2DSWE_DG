# 2DSWE_DG
In this project, the two-dimensional shallow water equations (SWE) are solved using the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) fnite-element method. The spatial domain is 
a city geometry consisting of four buildings in a rectangular, wall-bounded domain. The initial condition is set to a Gaussian-shaped profile of the water surface, 
as is shown in the figure below.
